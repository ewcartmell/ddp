## Objective

The objective of this presentation is to describe an app built in Shiny that allows you to explore the MTCars dataset.  

## The App

The application is available at this link: https://nedcartmell.shinyapps.io/mtcars/

## Data

The MTCars dataset is a data frame consisting of 32 observations of 11 variables relating to performance and other characteristics of various models of cars.  You can read more about the dataset here: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html

## Here is an example of some R code

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(mtcars$mpg)
```

## Au Revoir!

```{r pressure}
plot(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)
```
